# Type Theory

This repository contains practical homework from type theory course.

## Task 1
Given an arbitrary untyped lambda expression &mdash; build expression tree and then print the expression with all parentheses in-place.

## Task 2
Given an arbitrary untyped lambda expression which has normal form &mdash; find it's beta normal form and print it alongside with all beta-reduction steps.

## Task 3
Given an arbitrary untyped lambda expression &mdash; find the most general type using unification algorithm (light version of algorithm **W** which is used in Hindley-Milner's type system) and print all the steps of achieving the needed type. Also, inform the user if the expression has no type.
